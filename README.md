# Dorrel's Custom Nix Configurations

This is very much still a work-in-progress. However, I am attempting to make things as modular as possible to allow me to implement Nix on each of my systems that I use on a regular basis. The will likely be many restructures during this process and I'll readily admit that my commits may get a bit... spread out, but I will do my best to follow good practices as I am using this entire project as a learning experience for using GitHub in a more proper manner.

## Credits
While I am attempting to primarily only take inspiration from other people's dotfiles, some code snippets are taken verbatim as I slowly work everything up. The people I am taking either inspiration or direct code from are as follows:
