# Dorrel's Custom Nix Configurations

This is very much still a work-in-progress. However, I am attempting to make things as modular as possible to allow me to implement Nix on each of my systems that I use on a regular basis. There will likely be many restructures during this process and I'll readily admit that my commits may get a bit... messy, but I will do my best to follow good practices as I am using this entire project as a learning experience for using GitHub in a more proper manner.

## Credits
While I am attempting to primarily only take inspiration from other people's dotfiles, some code snippets are taken verbatim as I slowly work everything up. Thank you to the following people for all of your amazing work and sharing your own configurations! You have truly made things so much easier for me through this process ^-^
